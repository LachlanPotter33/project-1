What are the impacts of Cost of Living Increasing against Median Income.

Income v Cost of Living [Line graph][Base]

## Cost of Living v Wage [Matias]

In this analysis, we compared the trend of the Cost of Living (measured by the Consumer Price Index, CPI) against the trend of the average Wage (represented by the Wage Price Index, WPI). By examining quarterly data over several years, we observed how changes in the Cost of Living corresponded with changes in the Wage. This comparison helps us understand whether wage growth has kept pace with increases in the cost of essential goods and services.

## Cost of Living v Inflation [Matias]

In this analysis, we explored the relationship between the Cost of Living (CPI) and the broader economic indicator of Inflation. While the CPI focuses specifically on consumer goods and services, inflation encompasses a broader range of economic factors. By comparing these two metrics, we gain insights into how changes in the overall price level of goods and services affect the Cost of Living for individuals and households.

# Inflation v Fuel rate [Maddie]
In this Analysis we compared the fuel retail rate to the inflation rate, to find how much the price of fuel has an impact on the rate of inflation. 
Looking at our Line Graph you can see that fuel was heading down in 2018- 2020 while inflation rate was slowly increasing, however once Covid hit both the Inflation rate and the fuel pricing movement both followed the same trend of a movement of around 4.30% for the year of 2021, while between 2021 and 2022 fule grew a whopping 24.64% between the two grades of fuel ( Disesl and Petrol products ) while inflation only moved 8.05. 
This shows the even though Fuel pricing can have a huge affect on inflation, there are other factors like covid and wars that also effect inflation line and more investigation would be needed. 
	
#Inflation vs Exchange Rate
In this Analyisation we looked at how the Exchange rate can affect the inflation rate, looking at our line graph we can see that pre covid (2020) the exchange rate didn't have any affect on the inflation rate as it had a decline of 15.48% the inflation rate only moved 1.05%. 
After 2020 both the exchange rate and the inflation rate started to both increase however not at the same rate.
