## Cost of Living v Wage [Matias]

In this analysis, we compared the trend of the Cost of Living (measured by the Consumer Price Index, CPI) against the trend of the average Wage (represented by the Wage Price Index, WPI). By examining quarterly data over several years, we observed how changes in the Cost of Living corresponded with changes in the Wage. This comparison helps us understand whether wage growth has kept pace with increases in the cost of essential goods and services.

## Cost of Living v Inflation [Matias]

In this analysis, we explored the relationship between the Cost of Living (CPI) and the broader economic indicator of Inflation. While the CPI focuses specifically on consumer goods and services, inflation encompasses a broader range of economic factors. By comparing these two metrics, we gain insights into how changes in the overall price level of goods and services affect the Cost of Living for individuals and households.
