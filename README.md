## Cost of Living v Wage [Matias]

In this analysis, we compared the trend of the Cost of Living (measured by the Consumer Price Index, CPI) against the trend of the average Wage (represented by the Wage Price Index, WPI). By examining quarterly data over several years, we observed how changes in the Cost of Living corresponded with changes in the Wage. This comparison helps us understand whether wage growth has kept pace with increases in the cost of essential goods and services.

## Cost of Living v Inflation [Matias]

In this analysis, we explored the relationship between the Cost of Living (CPI) and the broader economic indicator of Inflation. While the CPI focuses specifically on consumer goods and services, inflation encompasses a broader range of economic factors. By comparing these two metrics, we gain insights into how changes in the overall price level of goods and services affect the Cost of Living for individuals and households.

## Inflation v Fuel rate [Maddie]
In this Analysis we compared the fuel retail rate to the inflation rate, to find how much the price of fuel has an impact on the rate of inflation. 
Looking at our Line Graph you can see that fuel was heading down in 2018- 2020 while inflation rate was slowly increasing, however once Covid hit both the Inflation rate and the fuel pricing movement both followed the same trend of a movement of around 4.30% for the year of 2021, while between 2021 and 2022 fule grew a whopping 24.64% between the two grades of fuel ( Disesl and Petrol products ) while inflation only moved 8.05. 
This shows the even though Fuel pricing can have a huge affect on inflation, there are other factors like covid and wars that also effect inflation line and more investigation would be needed.

#Inflation vs Exchange Rate
In this Analyisation we looked at how the Exchange rate can affect the inflation rate, looking at our line graph we can see that pre covid (2020) the exchange rate didn't have any affect on the inflation rate as it had a decline of 15.48% the inflation rate only moved 1.05%. 
After 2020 both the exchange rate and the inflation rate started to both increase however not at the same rate.

## The impact of Dwellings on Inflation, and its impact [Lachlan]
The impact of dwellings on inflation and its implications.
In the final analysis of our research, we compared the dwelling prices to income, inflation, and CPI to review their impact.
To start, we acknowledge the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) definition of dwelling as "a structure that is intended to have people live in it," which is further concluded to be defined as the value of houses, units, and apartment complexes, in summary.
Reviewing ABS data, we are provided with the value of each capital city’s dwelling as well as an Australian average for each quarter.
For our research, we have simply reviewed the Australia Total Average given value as our measure over the period spanning 2018–2023. This was in conjunction with using the ABS's data on Australian employed income rates from 2018–2023. These data pools were then cleaned and merged.
In addition, we articulated a percentage change per quarter, to assist in our analysis later.
Furthermore, a year-only version of the data was created with the averages of each year to be reviewed more precisely against the other annual percentage changes previously provided within the research.
Below, you can see the tables for the following data:

From the table and our bar graph, ‘Comparison of Income and Dwelling Prices', it is evident that both income and dwelling prices have increased.
Dwelling over the 5-year period had a total increase of 44.84%, which is $286,500.00.
This dwelling value increase is a result of demand.
Demand impacts dwelling as it reflects competition between bidders; a higher demand means more bidders and a higher chance of dwelling selling over value. Decreased demand results in fewer bidders and a higher chance of dwellings selling below value.
Income, however, grew by 20.93%, which only reflects $11,700.
The increase in dwellings has impacted and influenced the inflation rate, as it holds, on average, a 22.8% weight on the inflation index between 2018-2023.
What does this mean?
This means 22.8% of the inflation rate is reflected in the value of dwellings, and so in turn, when dwelling values increase or decrease, so too does inflation.
This is clearly visible in the bar and line graphs titled “Comparison of Income, Dwelling, and Inflations: % Change per Year’.
Key highlights include the dwellings increased in 2020–2021, which caused inflation to increase over 2021–2022.
As the dwelling increase rate lowered and decreased over 2022–2023, inflation in turn followed a similar pattern in 2023.
How is this having an impact?
This has an impact on the Australian employed census, as they did not receive an equal increase in their annual income at the same rate as inflation and dwellings did.
The impact of a non-equal increase is that, as inflation and CPI increase more than the increase in annual income, the Australian employed census will have an increase in their total spending.
An increase in total spending results in a decrease in savings for the Australian employed census.
If the Australian employed census is unable to decrease savings, however, a decrease in the amount of spending is found. That decrease is represented by fewer goods or services for the same spending amount as previous years.
As dwelling prices increase, individuals desiring to purchase a dwelling must spend more or delay to save more if they cannot afford the market.
